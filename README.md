# python_pcap_agentic_learning

- THIS FILE WILL NOT BE MODIFIED BY THE AGENT - IT IS SOLELY MINE -

After successfully using Claude as my programming teacher for the PCEP exam (passed on Dec 30, 2025), I decided to continue using this strategy and the current goals are:

- to pass the PCAP exam
- to prepare a portfolio project in Python (trades backtesting engine)

I'm planning to achieve both goals by February 28, 2026.

This repository will showcase my learning process, and you can find all the tasks, feedback, exams and separate project parts that I will be working on DAILY.
PLEASE NOTE: WHILE I USE AGENT AS MY TUTOR, I AM NOT USING AI to complete any of the tasks, and the plan is to truly learn and understand all of the concepts on my own, and all of that requires my own work.

As for the commits in this repository, most likely they will be structured and done by the agent, and I will only be pushing them.
As for the agentic flow, while I truly appreciate the current tech advances, I still review all of the proposed changes and accept them manually, so all of the commits etc. will be approved by me and pushed manually.

As for the agent's instructions, I am not planning to publish them as of now, but this might change in the future.

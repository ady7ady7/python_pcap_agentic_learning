## Week 1, Day 1 - 2026-01-05

**Topic:** Modules, Packages & Import Mechanisms
**Score:** 8/8 tasks completed | 86.25%
**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard (mixed)

**Tasks Completed:**
1. Import variants (absolute, selective, alias, wildcard)
2. sys.path investigation and manipulation
3. Circular import debugging
4. AlgoBacktest project structure setup
5. Dependency checker with exception handling
6. Name shadowing edge cases
7. PCAP multiple choice (module imports)
8. Lazy import pattern implementation

**Key Learnings:** Import execution order, package structure patterns, exception handling, PEP 8 compliance

## Week 1, Day 2 - 2026-01-06

**Topic:** Strings, Exceptions & File I/O
**Score:** 8/8 tasks completed | 78.75%
**Difficulty:** Too Hard (8/10)

**Tasks Completed:**
1. String slicing edge cases (all correct predictions)
2. String methods comparison (find/index, strip variations, split)
3. safe_divide function with exception handling
4. Exception catching order debug
5. DataLoader class with CSV loading and error handling
6. validate_data method for DataFrame validation
7. read_config function with file I/O edge cases
8. PCAP multiple choice (try/except/else/finally execution order)

**Key Learnings:** String immutability, slicing never raises IndexError, `.find()` returns -1, exception hierarchy order matters, context managers for file I/O

**Issues Identified:** Curriculum sequencing error - OOP and advanced Pandas expected without prior instruction

## Week 1, Day 3 - 2026-01-07

**Topic:** OOP Fundamentals - Classes, Objects & Methods
**Score:** 9/9 tasks completed | 97.5%
**Difficulty:** Manageable (6/10)

**Tasks Completed:**
1. Understanding `self` (predict Counter output)
2. Instance vs class attributes (predict Dog species behavior)
3. BankAccount class implementation
4. Mutable class attributes trap hunt (TodoList bug)
5. Position class for trading positions (with explicit `side` parameter)
6. DataLoader bug fixes from Day 2 feedback
7. PCAP multiple choice (class/instance attributes, `__init__` returns)
8. OHLCCandle enhancement (doji detection, wick calculations)
9. Bonus: Employee class with auto-incrementing IDs

**Key Learnings:** Classes vs objects (blueprint analogy), `self` as object reference, instance attributes vs class attributes, mutable class attribute traps, connection to mutable default parameters, `__init__` constructor, methods vs functions

**Student Insights:**
- Challenged mentor's signed quantity spec (crypto-only, not industry standard)
- Implemented explicit `side` parameter (correct for futures/CFDs/stocks)
- Self-debugged `or` vs `and` logic error
- Lesson structure worked - material was sufficient for task completion

## Week 1, Day 4 - 2026-01-08

**Topic:** Magic Methods & Pandas Essentials
**Score:** 9/9 tasks completed | 93.5%
**Difficulty:** Easy-Medium (5/10)

**Tasks Completed:**
1. `__str__` vs `__repr__` output predictions
2. Magic method trap hunt (missing return statement)
3. Add `__str__` and `__repr__` to Position class
4. Pandas `.any()` drill (three approaches to NaN checking)
5. Boolean indexing practice (filtering OHLC data)
6. Trade class with P&L calculation and magic methods
7. PCAP multiple choice (magic methods, Pandas and/or operators)
8. DataLoader enhancements (`__repr__`, candle counting, filtering)
9. Bonus: Trade class method for win rate calculation

**Key Learnings:** `__str__` vs `__repr__` distinction, magic method fallback behavior, Pandas `.any()` semantics, boolean indexing with `&` operator, class methods, PEP 8 line length compliance

**Student Contributions:**
- Corrected mentor on Task 2 (TypeError IS raised)
- Defended PEP 8 formatting in multi-line f-strings
- Validated P&L calculations ($50 correct, not $500)
- Pandas teaching gap officially closed

## Week 1, Day 1 - 2026-01-05

**Topic:** Modules, Packages & Import Mechanisms

### Student Self-Assessment
- **Tasks Completed:** 8/8
- **Difficulty:** Just Right / Too Hard (mixed)
- **Time Spent:** 1.5 hours

### Student Reflection
**What clicked:**
- General understanding of importing and different import patterns

**What's confusing:**
- File clutter from creating separate files for every task
- Preference for using `practice.py` as scratch workspace (PCEP methodology)
- Question about `__init__.py` relevance in 2026

**Project Progress:**
- AlgoBacktest structure is simple so far
- Concerns about file organization going forward

### Mentor Assessment

**Score: 86.25% (B+)**

**Task Breakdown:**
1. Import Variants: 90% - All styles correct, minor misunderstanding about PI overwrite direction
2. sys.path Investigation: 100% - Perfect execution
3. Circular Import: 70% - Works but missed lazy import pattern (imported from same folder instead of lazy loading)
4. AlgoBacktest Setup: 100% - `from __init__ import` was CORRECT - mentor error in task structure
5. Dependency Checker: 85% - Clean code, valid critique about importlib not being taught
6. Name Shadowing: 75% - Correct diagnosis, professional instinct to reject sys.path hack
7. Multiple Choice: 100% - Correct answer with solid reasoning
8. Lazy Import: 60% - Code works but missed core use case (startup optimization)

**Strengths:**
- Professional instincts (rejecting bad patterns)
- Clean exception handling
- Critical thinking and constructive feedback

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Understand lazy import use cases (startup time, optional features)
- Package imports should use package name, not `__init__` directly
- Practice lazy import pattern for circular dependency resolution

**Critical Corrections:**
- Task 3: Use `from broken_pkg.engine import start` INSIDE the function (lazy import)
- Task 4: Student solution was CORRECT - mentor gave bad package structure (main.py inside package folder)

**Action Items:**
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md to use `practice.py` workflow (no file clutter)
- ✅ Added daily assessment protocol to instructions
- Confirmed `__init__.py` is still relevant for professional projects
- Deferred importlib to Week 7 (not on PCAP exam)

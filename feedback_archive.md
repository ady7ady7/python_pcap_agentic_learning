## Week 1, Day 1 - 2026-01-05

**Topic:** Modules, Packages & Import Mechanisms

### Student Self-Assessment
- **Tasks Completed:** 8/8
- **Difficulty:** Just Right / Too Hard (mixed)
- **Time Spent:** 1.5 hours

### Student Reflection
**What clicked:**
- General understanding of importing and different import patterns

**What's confusing:**
- File clutter from creating separate files for every task
- Preference for using `practice.py` as scratch workspace (PCEP methodology)
- Question about `__init__.py` relevance in 2026

**Project Progress:**
- AlgoBacktest structure is simple so far
- Concerns about file organization going forward

### Mentor Assessment

**Score: 86.25% (B+)**

**Task Breakdown:**
1. Import Variants: 90% - All styles correct, minor misunderstanding about PI overwrite direction
2. sys.path Investigation: 100% - Perfect execution
3. Circular Import: 70% - Works but missed lazy import pattern (imported from same folder instead of lazy loading)
4. AlgoBacktest Setup: 100% - `from __init__ import` was CORRECT - mentor error in task structure
5. Dependency Checker: 85% - Clean code, valid critique about importlib not being taught
6. Name Shadowing: 75% - Correct diagnosis, professional instinct to reject sys.path hack
7. Multiple Choice: 100% - Correct answer with solid reasoning
8. Lazy Import: 60% - Code works but missed core use case (startup optimization)

**Strengths:**
- Professional instincts (rejecting bad patterns)
- Clean exception handling
- Critical thinking and constructive feedback

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Understand lazy import use cases (startup time, optional features)
- Package imports should use package name, not `__init__` directly
- Practice lazy import pattern for circular dependency resolution

**Critical Corrections:**
- Task 3: Use `from broken_pkg.engine import start` INSIDE the function (lazy import)
- Task 4: Student solution was CORRECT - mentor gave bad package structure (main.py inside package folder)

**Action Items:**
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md to use `practice.py` workflow (no file clutter)
- ✅ Added daily assessment protocol to instructions
- Confirmed `__init__.py` is still relevant for professional projects
- Deferred importlib to Week 7 (not on PCAP exam)

## Week 1, Day 2 - 2026-01-06

**Topic:** Strings, Exceptions & File I/O

### Student Self-Assessment
- **Tasks Completed:** 8/8
- **Difficulty:** Too Hard (8/10)
- **Time Spent:** Not specified

### Student Reflection
**What clicked:**
- String methods (find/index, strip, split) edge cases
- Exception handling order (specific → general)
- Context managers for file I/O

**What's confusing/Frustrating:**
- Expected to use classes (OOP) without any prior instruction
- Advanced Pandas operations (`.isna().sum()`, `.any()`) not taught yet
- Missing test files for Task 7 (`read_config` function)
- Curriculum asks for things before teaching them

**Legitimate Complaints:**
- "You've asked me to do a lot of things we didn't learn, and expected me to use classes when we literally didn't ever learn them"
- "WE DID NOT PROPERLY LEARN THESE THINGS THAT YOU'RE EXPECTING ME TO DO YET"
- "I CANNOT REALLY TEST THAT CONFIG... it doesn't seem like a part of a proper learning process"

### Mentor Assessment

**Score: 78.75% (C+)**

**Task Breakdown:**
1. String Slicing Edge Cases: 100% - All answers correct (mentor initially wrong on #5)
2. String Methods: 100% - Excellent observations, identified `.find()` returning -1 trap
3. safe_divide Function: 95% - Clean exception handling, proper order, good docstring
4. Exception Order Debug: 100% - Identified error, fixed correctly, clear explanation
5. DataLoader Class: 70% - Functional but incomplete (missing context manager, return None on ValueError)
6. validate_data Method: 60% - Logic errors (`set(df.columns) - set(df.columns)` always empty, isna check incorrect)
7. read_config Function: 85% - Clean code, proper exception handling, missing PermissionError return statement
8. PCAP Multiple Choice: 100% - Correct answer with clear reasoning

**Bonus Task:** 90% - Clean f-string usage, missing thousands separator (`:,` format)

**Strengths:**
- String manipulation mastery (all edge cases correct)
- Exception handling order understanding
- Critical feedback and constructive criticism
- Professional code structure (type hints, docstrings)

**Critical Code Issues:**

**Task 5 (DataLoader):**
```python
# ISSUE 1: No context manager used (requirement violated)
data = pd.read_csv(self.filepath)  # Should use 'with' statement

# ISSUE 2: ValueError exception doesn't return None
except ValueError as e:
    print(f'Value Error! {str(e)}')
    # Missing: return None
```

**Task 6 (validate_data):**
```python
# ISSUE 1: Logic error - this is always empty
missing_columns = set(df.columns) - set(df.columns)  # Should be: set(req_columns) - set(df.columns)

# ISSUE 2: isna() check is incorrect
nan_values = df[req_columns].isna().sum()
if nan_values.any():  # This checks if ANY column has NaN, but doesn't fail properly
```

**Task 7 (read_config):**
```python
except PermissionError as e:
    print(f'Permission error: {str(e)}')
    # Missing: return {}
```

**Curriculum Errors Identified:**
1. **OOP Introduced Too Early:** Tasks 5-6 require class creation without teaching `__init__`, `self`, methods, or attributes first
2. **Advanced Pandas Not Taught:** Expected `.isna().sum()`, `.any()`, DataFrame boolean indexing without instruction
3. **Missing Test Files:** Task 7 requires file to test against (bad pedagogy)
4. **Prerequisite Gap:** Teaching order violated (concepts used before explained)

**Action Items:**
- ✅ Acknowledged curriculum error publicly
- ⚠️ CRITICAL: Day 3 MUST introduce OOP fundamentals (classes, `__init__`, `self`, methods) BEFORE any class-building tasks
- ⚠️ Create Pandas mini-lesson covering DataFrame operations before next data task
- ⚠️ Provide sample files for all file I/O tasks going forward
- Update curriculum to ensure teaching precedes application

**Mentor Note:** User's frustration is 100% valid. This was a significant instructional design failure. The score reflects what the student COULD know given proper instruction, not what they should have been expected to know.
